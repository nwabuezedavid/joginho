<h2 class="heading medium">5. Online Tracking and Advertising</h2>
<p>We recognize Global Privacy Control (GPC), which is a setting that allows you to communicate your privacy preferences to websites and online services that you visit. When we detect a GPC signal from a browser, our online services are designed to treat the browser as opted out and to stop sharing personal information for certain targeted advertising purposes, in accordance with applicable laws. Please visit the <a title="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="Visit the Global Privacy Control website. Opens in a new tab." class="external-linked" data-entry-point="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">Global Privacy Control</a> website to learn more about the setting and how to enable it on your browser.</p>
<p>You can also opt out of certain targeted advertising by visiting <a title="https://youradchoices.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="YourAdChoices website. Opens in a new tab." class="external-linked" data-entry-point="https://youradchoices.com/">YourAdChoices.com</a>&nbsp;and by adjusting the privacy settings on your mobile device (e.g., “Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” on Android). You may be able to set your web browser to tell you when cookies are set, delete your cookies, or block cookies altogether. Please check your browser’s settings or support pages to learn how to manage cookies and other tracking technologies on your browser or device.</p>
<p>We use advertising platforms, The Trade Desk and LiveRamp, to help us execute our marketing campaigns. These third parties may also provide you with the ability to further limit the use and sharing of your information for advertising purposes with their other clients. You may visit The Trade Desk at <a title="https://adsrvr.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="Visit the Trade Desk website. Opens in a new tab." class="external-linked" data-entry-point="https://adsrvr.org/">https://adsrvr.org/</a> and LiveRamp at <a title="https://liveramp.com/privacy/" target="_blank" aria-label="Visit the LiveRamp website.

<p>Please note that your preferences will apply only to the specific browser or device from which you opt out. You will need to opt out separately on all your browsers and devices. If you delete cookies, change web browsers, reset your mobile advertising ID, or use a different device, you may need to opt out again. <b>If you choose to reject cookies, some features of our online services (including account access to our digital services) may no longer function. Please see your <i>Digital Services Agreement </i>with us for details.</b></p>
<p>Please note that even if you opt out, you may still receive online advertising from us. Opting out from a specific advertising provider means that the ads you do receive will not be based on your preferences or behavior. In addition, you may still see targeted pages based on your habits as you navigate our online services, including <a title="/index.html" target="_self" aria-label="Go to the U.S. Bank global homepage">www.usbank.com</a>.</p>
<p>You may have additional rights to opt out of our use of your information depending on how you interact with us, the financial products or services you may ultimately obtain from us, or the jurisdiction in which we are doing business with you. For example, if you do not want us to serve you targeted advertising based on your visit to our online services, you can opt out of targeted advertising by selecting&nbsp;<a title="https://onlinebanking.usbank.com/digital/servicing/privacy-preferences/" target="_self" aria-label="Learn about your U.S. Bank privacy choices">Your privacy choices</a>.</p>

<p>To help us protect your personal information, it is important that you always keep your account information safe. Do not share your username, password, or PIN with anyone.</p>
<p>We will never initiate (unless otherwise stated for a specific product or service application), a request via email for your sensitive information (for example, Social Security number, username, password, PIN or account number). If you receive an email asking for your sensitive information, you should be suspicious of the request and promptly contact us to report the suspicious activity.</p>
<p>Please be aware, however, that in certain telephone and in-person transactions we may ask for your full Social Security number, account number or other information to verify your identity before conducting the transactions you have requested. For example, we may ask for such information to verify your identity when you place a call to us, when you visit a U.S.&nbsp;Bank branch office or when we call you about a new product or service, we believe that you will find valuable. We will never request that you disclose your personal ID, password or PIN under any circumstances, including such telephone or in-person transactions.</p>

<p>Some companies offer financial management tools that allow you to access account information (including account statements and tax documents) from a variety of sources so that you can view multiple accounts at a single online location. These services may require you to provide personal identification information, including specific account information and your log-in credentials. By providing your log-in credentials to such a service you authorize that service to access your account which may include the ability to initiate transfers to or from your account. Please use caution when providing personal information and log-in credentials to third party service providers and read and understand the third party’s privacy and security policies before sharing any personal information with the service. Any use of a third-party site is at your own risk. If you elect to provide your log-in credentials or other information about your accounts to a third party, you are responsible for the use of your account or the disclosure of any personal information by the third party. Should you decide to revoke any access you have given to a third party, you must contact us, in which case we may need to block your access to our digital services until we issue new log-in credentials.</p>
